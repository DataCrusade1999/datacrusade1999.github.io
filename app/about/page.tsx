                    I&#39;m currently a front-end engineer at Remote. I enjoy working on React and all
                    things JavaScript/TypeScript and am a big believer in the functional programming
                    paradigm â€” lately, I&#39;ve been interested in learning Elixir.

                    I&#39;m a self-taught developer with a degree in CSE  from ABESIT,
                    Ghaziabad (psst, my alma mater&#39;s was the first big website I worked on!). I&#39;ve
                    been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google
                    for the first time.

                    In the past, I&#39;ve worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and
                    been responsible for python and UI rewrites. I&#39;ve continued working with React and
                    TypeScript since then and love the experiece, along with a bunch of other tooling â€” I
                    firmly believe in developer tooling which allows one to become a 1.1x developer . ðŸ˜‰

                    Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my
                    college&#39;s Quiz Club. Having played a lot of CS in my childhood and college, I also
                    love following the CS:GO esports scene. I enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk r/mk
                    pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and <Link className="font-extrabold
